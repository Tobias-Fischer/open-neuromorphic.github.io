Most of us have never met in person before but have started contributing to a common or each other&amp;rsquo;s projects! What connects us is the love for building tools that can be used in the neuromorphic community and we want to share ownership of this vision. If you feel like that resonates with you, please don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to get in touch!</description></item><item><title>Events</title><link>https://open-neuromorphic.org/events/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-neuromorphic.org/events/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://open-neuromorphic.org/img/ONM.png" alt="Featured image of post Events" />Upcoming events Join our newsletter to be updated on new events and get a reminder!
2023-09-26: Giulia D&amp;rsquo;Angelo, What&amp;rsquo;s catching your eye? The visual attention mechanism Giulia D&amp;rsquo;Angelo
Time 6PM-7:30PM, CEST.
Abstract Every agent, whether animal or robotic, needs to process its visual sensory input in an efficient way, to allow understanding of, and interaction with, the environment. The process of filtering revelant information out of the continuous bombardment of complex sensory data is called selective attention.</description></item><item><title>Events recordings</title><link>https://open-neuromorphic.org/events-recordings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-neuromorphic.org/events-recordings/</guid><description>2023-01-26: Trevor Bekolay, Nengo - Applied Brain Research Recording https://youtu.be/sgu9l_bqAHM

Speaker&amp;rsquo;s bio Trevor Bekolay’s primary research interest is in learning and memory. In his Master’s degree, he explored how to do supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning in networks of biologically plausible spiking neurons. In his PhD, he applied this knowledge to the domain of speech to explore how sounds coming into the ear become high-level linguistic representations, and how those representations become sequences of vocal tract movements that produce speech.</description></item><item><title>Getting involved</title><link>https://open-neuromorphic.org/getting-involved/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-neuromorphic.org/getting-involved/</guid><description>The easiest way to get in touch is probably through Discord, where we discuss research topics, job opportunities, open hardware, spiking neural network training and much more. We&amp;rsquo;d be delighted to have you join! If you feel like contributing to ONM but you&amp;rsquo;re not exactly sure how, here are some ideas to get you started:
Link an interesting open source repository to our collection so that others can find it too!</description></item><item><title>Resources</title><link>https://open-neuromorphic.org/resources/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-neuromorphic.org/resources/</guid><description>Please check our Github repository for a list of neuromorphic open source software and hardware!</description></item><item><title>Team</title><link>https://open-neuromorphic.org/team/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-neuromorphic.org/team/</guid><description>Fabrizio Ottati Fabrizio Ottati
Fabrizio Ottati is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electronics and Communications of Politecnico di Torino, under the supervision of professor Luciano Lavagno and professor Mario Roberto Casu.
His main interests are event-based cameras, digital hardware design and automation, spiking neural networks and piedmontese red wine. He is the maintainer of two open source projects in the field of neuromorphic computing, Tonic and Expelliarmus. You can find more information on his website.</description></item></channel></rss>
