As the sizes of spiking neural network models grow thanks to deep learning, optimization becomes more important for researchers and practitioners alike. Training SNNs is often slow, as the stateful networks are typically fed sequential inputs. Today&amp;rsquo;s most popular training method then is some form of backpropagation through time, whose time complexity scales with the number of time steps.</description></item><item><title>Bits of Chips | TrueNorth</title><link>https://open-neuromorphic.org/p/bits-of-chips-truenorth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-neuromorphic.org/p/bits-of-chips-truenorth/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://open-neuromorphic.org/p/bits-of-chips-truenorth/brain-to-chip.png" alt="Featured image of post Bits of Chips | TrueNorth" />Why do we want to emulate the brain? If you have ever read an article on neuromorphic computing, you might have noticed that in the introduction of each of these there is the same statement: &amp;ldquo;The brain is much powerful than any AI machine when it comes to cognitive tasks but it runs on a 10W power budget!&amp;rdquo;. This is absolutely true: neurons in the brain communicate among each other by means of spikes, which are short voltage pulses that propagate from one neuron to the other.</description></item><item><title>Efficient compression for event-based data</title><link>https://open-neuromorphic.org/p/efficient-compression-for-event-based-data/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-neuromorphic.org/p/efficient-compression-for-event-based-data/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://open-neuromorphic.org/p/efficient-compression-for-event-based-data/file_read_benchmark.png" alt="Featured image of post Efficient compression for event-based data" />Efficient compression for event-based data Datasets grow larger in size As neuromorphic algorithms tackle more complex tasks that are linked to bigger datasets, and event cameras mature to have higher spatial resolution, it is worth looking at how to encode that data efficiently when storing it on disk. To give you an example, Prophesee&amp;rsquo;s latest automotive object detection dataset is some 3.5 TB in size for under 40h of recordings with a single camera.</description></item><item><title>Digital neuromophic hardware read list</title><link>https://open-neuromorphic.org/p/digital-neuromophic-hardware-read-list/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-neuromorphic.org/p/digital-neuromophic-hardware-read-list/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://open-neuromorphic.org/p/digital-neuromophic-hardware-read-list/frenkel-thesis.png" alt="Featured image of post Digital neuromophic hardware read list" />Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of articles and theses related to digital hardware designs for neuomorphic applications.

If you are new to neuromorphic computing, I strongly suggest to get a grasp of how an SNN works from this paper. Otherwise, it will be pretty difficult to understand the content of the papers listed here.

To do so, we will consider a single output neuron connected to multiple input neurons from a previous layer.
In a Spiking Neural Network (SNN), neurons communicate by means of spikes: these activation voltages are then converted to currents through the synapses, charging the membrane potential of the destination neuron.</description></item><item><title>Open Neuromorphic</title><link>https://open-neuromorphic.org/p/open-neuromorphic/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-neuromorphic.org/p/open-neuromorphic/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://open-neuromorphic.org/p/open-neuromorphic/ONM.png" alt="Featured image of post Open Neuromorphic" />This organisation is created by a loose collective of open source collaborators across academia, industry and individual contributors.

2023-09-26: Giulia D&amp;rsquo;Angelo, What&amp;rsquo;s catching your eye? The visual attention mechanism Giulia D&amp;rsquo;Angelo
Time 6PM-7:30PM, CEST.
Abstract Every agent, whether animal or robotic, needs to process its visual sensory input in an efficient way, to allow understanding of, and interaction with, the environment. The process of filtering revelant information out of the continuous bombardment of complex sensory data is called selective attention.</description></item><item><title>Events recordings</title><link>https://open-neuromorphic.org/events-recordings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-neuromorphic.org/events-recordings/</guid><description>2023-01-26: Trevor Bekolay, Nengo - Applied Brain Research Recording https://youtu.be/sgu9l_bqAHM

Speaker&amp;rsquo;s bio Trevor Bekolay’s primary research interest is in learning and memory. In his Master’s degree, he explored how to do supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning in networks of biologically plausible spiking neurons. In his PhD, he applied this knowledge to the domain of speech to explore how sounds coming into the ear become high-level linguistic representations, and how those representations become sequences of vocal tract movements that produce speech.</description></item><item><title>Getting involved</title><link>https://open-neuromorphic.org/getting-involved/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-neuromorphic.org/getting-involved/</guid><description>The easiest way to get in touch is probably through Discord, where we discuss research topics, job opportunities, open hardware, spiking neural network training and much more.
