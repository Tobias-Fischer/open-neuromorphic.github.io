As the sizes of spiking neural network models grow thanks to deep learning, optimization becomes more important for researchers and practitioners alike. Training SNNs is often slow, as the stateful networks are typically fed sequential inputs. Today&amp;rsquo;s most popular training method then is some form of backpropagation through time, whose time complexity scales with the number of time steps.</description></item></channel></rss>
