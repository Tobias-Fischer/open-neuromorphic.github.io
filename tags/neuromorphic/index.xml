If you have ever read an article on neuromorphic computing, you might have noticed that in the introduction of each of these there is the same statement: &amp;ldquo;The brain is much powerful than any AI machine when it comes to cognitive tasks but it runs on a 10W power budget!&amp;rdquo;. This is absolutely true: neurons in the brain communicate among each other by means of spikes, which are short voltage pulses that propagate from one neuron to the other.</description></item><item><title>Digital neuromophic hardware read list</title><link>https://open-neuromorphic.org/p/digital-neuromophic-hardware-read-list/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-neuromorphic.org/p/digital-neuromophic-hardware-read-list/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://open-neuromorphic.org/p/digital-neuromophic-hardware-read-list/frenkel-thesis.png" alt="Featured image of post Digital neuromophic hardware read list" />Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of articles and theses related to digital hardware designs for neuomorphic applications. I plan to update it regularly. To be redirected directly to the sources, click on the titles!
If you are new to neuromorphic computing, I strongly suggest to get a grasp of how an SNN works from this paper. Otherwise, it will be pretty difficult to understand the content of the papers listed here.
